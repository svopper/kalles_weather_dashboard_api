# Kalle's Weather Dashboard API üå§

> API that consumes the DMI API and presents weather data through different endpoints.

üè† [api.weather.kols.dk](https://api.weather.kols.dk/)

## üåê Hosting

App is hosted on [api.weather.kols.dk](https://api.weather.kols.dk/).

SSL are managed through [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/net-services/loadbalancing/advanced/sslCertificates/list?project=kalles-weather-dashboard-api).

## üèó Setup

This app uses env variables to get API keys. The following keys are needed:

| **Variable**          | **Description**                                              | **Status** |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| DMI_MET_OBS_API_KEY   | Key to access to weather observation API                     | Required   |
| DMI_OCEAN_OBS_API_KEY | Key to access to ocean observartion API                      | Required   |
| REDIS_URL             | URL endpoint for the Redis Cache                             | Required   |
| REDIS_DB_PSWD         | The password the the Redis Cache database                    | Required   |
| PORT                  | The port that the app is exposed through on the host machine | Optional   |

During development, API keys should be stored as env variables on the OS. When deploying to production, proper API keys are injected in [pkg/common/envs/config.yaml](https://github.com/svopper/kalles_weather_dashboard_v2/blob/main/pkg/common/envs/config.yaml) from a GitHub Action. API keys are found on the [DMI Open Data platform](https://dmiapi.govcloud.dk/).

## Run the application

Run the commands `go run cmd/main.go`

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Deployment

The project is deployed to the [kalles-weather-dashboard-api](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?project=kalles-weather-dashboard-api)-project on Google Cloud Platform.

The application is deployed to GCP on every push to `main`. It is not possible to deploy through the `gcloud` CLI, due to API key injection in deployment process.

## üìö Documentation

### API endpoint documentation

Using Swagger ([gin-swagger](https://github.com/swaggo/gin-swagger)) to give endpoint overview. Navigate to `/swagger/index.html` to browse. Run `swag init -g cmd/main.go` to update docs.

Swagger doc strings has to be created on each endpoint. See https://github.com/swaggo/swag/blob/master/README.md#api-operation for more info.

## Data caching

For the weather observations, a Redis cache is setup to limit the interaction with the DMI API. The key format is `YYYY-M-D-min|max`, for the minimum or maximum temperature for a given date. When fetching data, the cache is checked first, then DMI API if there is no matching key.
